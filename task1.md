Client-Server Architecture:

Benefits:
1. You are free to build whatever UI you want on whatever platform you want, which is good since most modern software apps are expected to be available across multiple platforms
2. It is easy to map the path that the system takes (request from Client, response from Server)

Potential drawback:
1. With a lot of users, the central server for this architecture could get overwhelmed, leading to slow wait times for users.
