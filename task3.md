UML Class Relationships
Department – Faculty (Aggregation)
The relationship between Department and Faculty is an aggregation. This indicates that a department is composed of multiple faculty members, but faculty can exist independently of the department (i.e., their lifetimes are not strictly tied to the department). The diagram communicates that departments serve as a collection of faculty, and multiple faculty can be associated with the same department.

AlarmController – Sensor (Association)
The relationship between AlarmController and Sensor is an association. This shows that sensors and alarm controllers are connected because a sensor can trigger an alarm controller in a real-world context. The association implies that an alarm controller may be linked to one or more sensors, and each sensor can be related to an alarm controller, enabling interaction between the two classes.
